Foreword
--------

I am not expecting you to become a programmer or a geek. But since computer
skills are required everywhere in this age of information, I hope you can
benefit from knowledge about how computer programs work and how to work with
them efficiently. Besides, appreciating the brilliance of human intelligence is
full of joy, agreed?
