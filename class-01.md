#### Install Python ####

Python is already installed if you are using GNU/Linux or Mac OS X. But for Windows, you have to install if yourself. 

I recommend you to install Anaconda instead of the standard Python release, since installing packages might be a daunting task for beginners.

Anaconda can be downloaded from <http://repo.continuum.io/archive/.winzip/>.
