#### Install Python ####

Python is already installed if you are using GNU/Linux or Mac OS X. But for
Windows, you have to install if yourself. 

I recommend you to install Anaconda instead of the standard Python release,
since installing packages might be a daunting task for beginners. Anaconda ships
with lots of useful packages which you might need in the future.

Anaconda can be downloaded from <http://repo.continuum.io/archive/.winzip/>.

Please download `Anaconda3` since I will use Python 3 in the rest of my
tutorials.

Unzip the downloaded file and run the installer. You can handle it yourself.


=======================================

#### Play Around ####

It is not a good idea to learn tons of theories before you have any hand-on
experience. So let us begin by playing with it.

Open `IPython (Py 3.4) QTConsole` from you `Start Menu`. If the font size if too
small for you, press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `=` to zoom in.

Use this program as a calculator and try some simple math

```python3
In [1]: 365 * 24 * 3600
Out[1]: 31536000
```
